Dopamine is a neurotransmitter released in the brain to motivate you to achieve something. The body always tries to maintain homeostasis, so when you receive a dopamine boost, your body tries to counteract with some suffering, attempting to maintain homeostasis – opponent-process theory.

When you receive many stimuli originating from a dopamine source, your tolerance increases, so you need more doses than the first time to reach the same dopamine level. This causes dissatisfaction because you never receive the same amount of dopamine and the same feeling of happiness as the first time.

Dopamine comes before achievement, as Spider-Man explains, "If you expect disappointment, then you can never truly be disappointed," because when you have a routine for receiving dopamine and that routine is broken before achieving the goal, your dopamine level decreases.

We are cacti in a tropical forest, we transform the elements of a simple world into something that is a dopamine bomb, we transform scarcity into abundance. Something that should be difficult to achieve now needs to be avoided.
